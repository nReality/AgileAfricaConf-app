Also, the presenters will share common themes such as abductive                    reasoning, guerrilla testing, RITE, leaner research design, visibility of outputs, task breakdown and increased collaboration across the feature teams towards the delivery of Most Loved Product (MLP).

Define legacy as you wish, but the pain of trying to maintain consistent flow when we touch code after the first or umpteenth release into production is very real.  By far, legacy code is the biggest                       inhibitor to high efficiency in software delivery.  In this talk, I will cover various constraints that slow us down when working with legacy code.  I follow this up with a few strategies that I use to bring a legacy code base under control. Along the way, I also will                  point out techniques that promised a lot and failed me miserably (and why).  I wrap up the talk with an honest statement of what it takes to implement it, without the false promises of silver bullets, magic wands, evangelism and idealism.",

Someone who was virtually unknown in his own country until a documentary aired in 1980.  After 35 years, that documentary has finally been                  released into the public domain which will hopefully shed some light and fame onto the person responsible for turning around Japanese business after the 2nd World War. That man is Dr Deming. This talk runs through the history of what happened after World War 2 and who                  it is so relevant to everyone in the Agile, Lean, etc... world. Practical advice is pulled from original works dating back 6o years and applied to current business & software development problems.",

Projects carry a lot of baggage too… documentation. Someone has to create it, someone has to read it, someone has to sign it, someone has to (or is meant to) maintain it, and eventually someone needs to identify if it is still valuable. That’s a lot of work for something we might not even use! Agile approaches value working software over comprehensive documentation. But what does that really mean? ",

At its core a Story comprises of one or more Scenarios, each of which represents a concrete example of the behavior of the system. Scenarios are written in Given, When, Then format, also known as Gherkin: Given/When/Then is a very powerful idiom, that allows for virtually any requirement to be described.

If you’re currently using build tools but unsure how it works, this talk will demystify the CI/CD for you.

We will dive into the layers of how an example CI/CD tool is built and we will end up showing how the actual build is run, tested or deployed. When you understand the system, you’ll know the limitations and how to overcome them.",

Yet, to remain religiously beholden to the original path is folly. In this talk, I will share the series of pivot points on a project that spanned two years, and the ultimate operational transformation that was achieved; far exceeding expectations.  But it did not come without the drama and pain at a team and organisational level.  There is also the brutality of honesty and the loneliness of courageous leadership needed to see the pivot through.",

These mutations generally make further changes to the software more difficult, longer to make, and introduce great risk.

The rest of the story is about my attempts to make that dream a reality – and the journey of successes, challenges and experiences in that process. The story is about my experiences and experiments with test automation, how we integrated them into the build stack and how we were able to enhance testing along with the productivity of the software development team.
